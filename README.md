# Weathermoon
Multi-LED IoT Project for 3D Printed Moon (with optional sensor inputs)

This project develops a shield for the Wemos D1 Mini which has:

 -- 3 LEDs (White, Warm White, and RGB - Common Cathode).

 -- One (1) 3-Pin connector (D8)
 
 -- One (1) 4-Pin connector (A0, D0)
 
 
The 3-Pin connector will be used for a DH11 or similar humidity and temperature module. 

The 4-Pin connector will be used for a battery monitoring/control circuit, or another analog device.
